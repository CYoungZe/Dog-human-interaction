# Dog-human-interaction
This is a project I did in CSCI 440 designing an animation by using WEBGL

The instructions for demonstrating this project:
The user must download entire project firstly!
When downloaded and unziped 
1. Go to class directory and double click Project4_23.html
2. Click the "Catch" button, you will see an action. Please wait for the action completed. 
3. Click the "Catch again" button, it's a quick action. If you want to see once more, you can only refresh browser or click "reset" button.
4. Click the "Chummy" button, it's a repeated action. Enjoy it!
5. Click the "Rest" button, it's only an action for moving position. 
6. Click the "Ruminate" button, human action.
7. Click the "Ignore" button, wait for a while to see whole action. 
8. Click the "Bored" button, a funny action. 
9. Click the "Angry" button.
10. Click the "fight" button, look carefully for what happened!

You have to follow this order throuhg 1-10, otherwise, the animation won't work well.
I expect to spend time making it perfect.
